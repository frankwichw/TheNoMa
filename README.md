# The NoMa
The NoMa draws inspiration from games like Pictionary, and transfers it to an online, asynchronous environment. Users can:
* Log in with their Google+ account
* Draw from a random prompt in their browser
* Guess what other users' drawings are supposed to be  
* Get points through correct answers or when other users rate your drawing highly
