# The NoMa
The NoMa draws inspiration from games like Pictionary, and transfers it to an online, asynchronous environment. Users can:
* Log in with their Google+ account
* draw from a random prompt in their browser
* guess what other users' drawings are supposed to be 
Correct answers get you points, and a drawing rating system also awards points the higher the drawing is rated.
